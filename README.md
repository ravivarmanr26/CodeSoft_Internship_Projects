TASK 1: MOVIE GENRE PREDICTION

Develop an advanced machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or textual data. Utilize cutting-edge techniques such as TF-IDF or sophisticated word embeddings combined with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle through CodeSoft, provides comprehensive information essential for genre classification.

TASK 2: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

Construct a robust model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Employ a dataset containing detailed transactional information and experiment with state-of-the-art algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The objective is to accurately distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, ensuring secure financial transactions for users. The dataset is curated from Kaggle under CodeSoft's guidance.

TASK 3: SPAM SMS DETECTION

Build an AI-powered model capable of classifying SMS messages as either spam or legitimate. Implement advanced techniques such as TF-IDF or advanced word embeddings in conjunction with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines. The dataset, curated from Kaggle with support from CodeSoft, facilitates the development of a robust spam detection system for enhanced communication security.
